Student Result Management System (SRMS)
Name: Okpogoro Henry Oghenekvwe 
Matric No: 23/12935
Department: Computer Science
. Planning
Defined the objective: build a simple system to compute and display student results.
Decided Python would be used as the programming language.
Determined that a file-based program (not web or database backend) was sufficient for the project scope.
Deliverables: Project idea, tools needed, basic goal statement.
2. Requirements Analysis
In this phase, the project author gathered what the system must do:
Functional requirements:
Accept student name input
Accept three numeric scores
Calculate total and average score
Assign grade based on average
Display the results
Non-functional requirements:
Must be a simple console program
Quick execution
Easy to read and understand code
Output: A list of features the program must implement. �
GitHub
3. System Design
Here the logic and structure of the program were defined:
Variables like name, score1, score2, etc.
Functions such as calculate_grade() to decide the grade
A function like student_result() to bring it all together
This phase planned how the code flows and how data moves through the program. �
GitHub
4. Implementation (Coding)
This is where the actual Python code was written:
Created srms.py
Implemented input collection
Added grade calculation logic
Printed results in the console
The code includes logic to compute total, average and determine the grade. �
GitHub
5. Testing
Testing is described in the README:
Running the script with different names and scores
Confirming that total, average, and grade output correctly
This ensures the functions work as expected before someone uses it. �
GitHub
6. Deployment
Deployment for this simple program is minimal:
The .py file is uploaded to the GitHub repository
Others can download or clone it to run in their Python environment
No server or cloud is involved for deployment. �
GitHub
7. Maintenance
Maintenance here can include:
Adding support for multiple students
Storing results in a file or database
Improving input validation
Enhancing user interface
